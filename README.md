## Intro

The goal of this project is to utilize class activation maps (specifically GradCAM), to better understand the spatial aesthetics as the
classifier understands them. Furthermore we explore potential uses of these activation maps for cropping
## Structure


## Contents

- `report.pdf` is our written report
- `MobileNetV2.py` contains code for implementation of Aesthatic Classification using a modified MobileNetV2 network.
- `VGG16.py` contains code for implementation of Aesthatic Classification using a modified MobileNetV2 network.

## Dataset 

We have used the AVA image dataset 

To download it via MEGA

Link: **[AVA Dataset](https://mega.nz/folder/9b520Lzb#2gIa1fgAzr677dcHKxjmtQ)**
  
The entire dataset has been split into **64 7z files**. Download **all** the zip files, unzip the first file and it should work. About **32GB** and **255,500** picture files.
